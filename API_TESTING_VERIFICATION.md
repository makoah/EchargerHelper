# API Rate Limiting Verification Test

## Quick Rate Limiting Test

To verify the 10-second rate limiting works:

1. **Launch app** on iPhone 12 Pro
2. **Select direction** and range
3. **Tap "Find Chargers"** → Should make API call
4. **Immediately change range** and tap "Find Chargers" again
5. **Expected**: Second request uses mock data (rate limited)
6. **Wait 10+ seconds** and try again
7. **Expected**: Should make API call again

## Rate Limiting Implementation Added ✅

- **Minimum interval**: 10 seconds between API calls
- **Fallback behavior**: Uses mock data when rate limited
- **User experience**: No indication to user (seamless fallback)
- **Protection**: Prevents excessive API usage during testing

This ensures responsible API usage during device testing while maintaining app functionality.
