- **Location Changes**: Move between different areas
- **Screen Time**: Keep app active throughout test

**Procedure:**
1. **Perform search every 5 minutes** (12 searches total)
2. **Move between locations** when possible
3. **Test different features**: Settings, charger details, etc.
4. **Monitor performance**: Note any slowdowns
5. **Record battery every 15 minutes**

**Expected Results:**
- **Target**: Under 20% battery drain in 1 hour
- **App Performance**: Should remain responsive
- **No Overheating**: iPhone should not get hot

## Battery Monitoring Tools

### Built-in iOS Tools
1. **Battery Settings**: Settings → Battery
   - View app-specific usage
   - Check background activity
   - Monitor screen vs background time

2. **Screen Time**: Settings → Screen Time
   - Track app usage duration
   - Verify background app refresh settings

### Xcode Energy Profiling (Optional)
If connected to Mac during testing:
1. **Open Xcode** with project
2. **Product → Profile** (⌘+I)
3. **Select Energy Profiling**
4. **Run tests** while profiling
5. **Analyze power consumption** patterns

## Test Environment Variables

### Factors Affecting Battery Results
- **Ambient Temperature**: Cold weather reduces battery capacity
- **Signal Strength**: Poor cellular/GPS signal increases power usage
- **Screen Brightness**: Higher brightness = more battery drain
- **Background Apps**: Other apps using location services
- **iPhone Age**: Older batteries have reduced capacity

### Standardizing Test Conditions

## Battery Optimization Recommendations

### Current App Optimizations ✅
- **Location Permission**: "When in Use" only
- **Rate Limiting**: 10-second minimum between API calls
- **Smart Fallback**: Uses mock data when GPS unavailable
- **Timeout Protection**: 10-second API timeout prevents hanging
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup in deinit

### Additional Optimizations (If Needed)
```swift
// Reduce location accuracy when battery low
if ProcessInfo.processInfo.isLowPowerModeEnabled {
    locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyHundredMeters
} else {
    locationManager.desiredAccuracy = kCLLocationAccuracyBest
}

// Stop location updates when not needed
func applicationDidEnterBackground() {
    locationManager.stopUpdatingLocation()
}
```

## Performance Benchmarks

### iPhone 12 Pro Targets
- **Stationary GPS**: 3-5% battery per 30 minutes
- **Mobile GPS**: 5-8% battery per 30 minutes  
- **Intensive Use**: 15-20% battery per hour
- **Background Impact**: Near zero when backgrounded

### Red Flags (Investigation Needed)
- **>10% drain** in 30 minutes stationary use
- **>15% drain** in 30 minutes mobile use
- **Device heating** during normal use
- **Continued drain** when app backgrounded
- **GPS not releasing** when app closed

## Troubleshooting Battery Issues

### High Battery Drain Debugging
1. **Check iOS Battery Usage**: Settings → Battery → Last 24 Hours
2. **Verify Background App Refresh**: Settings → General → Background App Refresh
3. **Review Location Services**: Settings → Privacy & Security → Location Services
4. **Monitor Other Apps**: Close all other apps during testing
5. **Restart iPhone**: Fresh state for accurate testing

### Common Battery Drain Causes
- **Continuous API calls** (should be rate-limited ✅)
- **Location services not stopping** when app backgrounded
- **Memory leaks** causing increased CPU usage
- **Network timeouts** causing retry loops
- **Background processing** when app should be idle

## Post-Testing Analysis

### Data Analysis Steps
1. **Calculate hourly drain rates** for each test scenario
2. **Compare to iPhone 12 Pro benchmarks**
3. **Identify any concerning patterns**
4. **Correlate with app usage patterns**
5. **Check for any background activity**

### Action Items Based on Results
- **If battery usage acceptable**: Proceed with release testing
- **If battery usage high**: Investigate location service optimization
- **If background drain detected**: Review app lifecycle management
- **If device heating**: Check for infinite loops or memory leaks
