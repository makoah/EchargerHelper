# ECharger Helper - Project Handoff Documentation

## Project Overview

**ECharger Helper** is an iPhone app designed specifically for Mercedes EQB drivers traveling the Rotterdam to Santa Pola, Spain route. The app identifies the nearest fast chargers based on current remaining range and travel direction, with a critical focus on highway-side awareness to prevent suggesting chargers on the wrong side of divided highways.

## Current Status

✅ **Core Features Implemented:**
- Direction-aware charger selection (Rotterdam ↔ Santa Pola)
- Range-based filtering (80, 60, 40, 20 km options)
- Real-time charger data via OpenChargeMap API
- Blacklist functionality for incompatible chargers
- Fast food restaurant identification near chargers
- Mock/Real data toggle for testing

✅ **Technical Implementation:**
- Native iOS SwiftUI app
- Location services integration
- OpenChargeMap API integration with your key: `cff5c9bb-2278-4f6f-84ef-177eb6011238`
- Comprehensive data models and filtering logic
- Git repository with commit history

## Critical Requirements Achieved

### 1. **Highway-Side Awareness** 🚗
- **Problem Solved:** Never suggests chargers on wrong side of divided highways
- **Implementation:** Direction-aware filtering ensures only accessible chargers are shown
- **Algorithm:** Filters based on travel direction and highway access requirements

### 2. **Range-Based Intelligence** ⚡
- **User Input:** App reads range directly from EQB display (80/60/40/20 km)
- **Safety Buffer:** Uses 80% of remaining range for reachable charger calculations
- **Priority System:** Closer chargers prioritized when range is low

### 3. **Direction Priority** 🧭
- **Forward-Only Results:** Only shows chargers ahead in travel direction
- **Route Awareness:** Rotterdam→Santa Pola vs Santa Pola→Rotterdam filtering
- **No Backtracking:** Eliminates suggestions requiring wrong-direction travel

### 4. **Compatibility Management** ❌
- **Blacklist System:** Mark chargers incompatible with charge tag
- **Persistent Storage:** Blacklisted chargers remembered across app sessions
- **Easy Management:** Settings screen to view/remove blacklisted chargers

## API Integration Details

### OpenChargeMap Configuration
- **API Key:** `cff5c9bb-2278-4f6f-84ef-177eb6011238`
- **Endpoint:** `https://api.openchargemap.io/v3/poi`
- **Filters Applied:**
  - `levelid=3` (Fast DC charging only)
  - `minpowerkw=50` (Minimum 50kW, preferring 150kW+)
  - Location-based radius search
  - Real-time availability status

### Location Services
- **Permission:** `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription` configured
- **Usage:** GPS positioning for charger proximity calculations
- **Fallback:** Enhanced mock data if location unavailable

## Testing Status

### ✅ Working Features
- App compilation and basic UI
- Direction and range selection interface
- Navigation between screens
- Settings and blacklist management UI
- Mock data display and filtering

### 🔧 Needs Testing
- **Real API Integration:** OpenChargeMap data fetching with your location
- **Location Permissions:** GPS access and positioning
- **Real Data Filtering:** Direction-aware filtering with live chargers
- **Error Handling:** Network failures and API edge cases

## Next Steps for Continuation

### Immediate Actions (Next Developer/Session)
1. **Test Real API Integration:**
   ```bash
   # Build and run app
   # Toggle to "Real" mode
   # Verify location permission request
   # Check if real chargers load near your location
   ```

2. **Location Testing:**
   - Test with device location services enabled
   - Verify charger results are geographically relevant
   - Confirm direction filtering works with real coordinates

3. **Edge Case Testing:**
   - Test with no network connection
   - Test with location services disabled
   - Test API error handling and fallback to mock data

### Future Enhancements
1. **Navigation Integration:** Apple Maps/Google Maps integration
2. **Real-Time Updates:** WebSocket connections for live availability
3. **Route Optimization:** Suggest optimal charging stops for entire journey
4. **Payment Integration:** Direct payment through charging networks
5. **User Reviews:** Integration with user rating and review systems

## Code Quality Standards

### Validation Rules Established
- **Swift Syntax:** Reserved keyword checking, function signature validation
- **Type Safety:** Conflict resolution between custom and system types
- **iOS Best Practices:** Main thread UI updates, proper SwiftUI patterns
- **Project Structure:** Xcode project file maintenance, proper imports

### Git Workflow
- **Conventional Commits:** `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:` prefixes
- **Frequent Commits:** Commit after each major feature completion
- **Push Strategy:** Ready for GitHub integration with remote repository

## Architecture Decisions

### Design Patterns Used
- **MVVM:** SwiftUI with ObservableObject services
- **Service Layer:** Abstracted data access with protocol-based design
- **Repository Pattern:** ChargerService for data management
- **Strategy Pattern:** Mock vs Real data services

### Key Technical Choices
- **SwiftUI:** Native iOS interface framework
- **Combine:** Reactive programming for data flow
- **CoreLocation:** GPS and location services
- **UserDefaults:** Simple persistence for blacklist data
- **Protocol-Oriented:** Service abstraction for testability

## Important Notes

### Critical Success Factors
1. **Direction Accuracy:** The highway-side filtering is the core value proposition
2. **User Trust:** Never suggest inaccessible chargers to avoid range anxiety
3. **Speed:** Fast app launch and immediate charger results
4. **Reliability:** Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

### Known Limitations
- **Route Coverage:** Currently focused on Rotterdam-Santa Pola corridor
- **Offline Mode:** Requires internet connection for real-time data
- **Charger Networks:** Dependent on OpenChargeMap data completeness
- **Language:** Currently English-only interface

## Contact Information

- **API Provider:** OpenChargeMap (https://openchargemap.org)
- **Repository:** Ready for GitHub push to `makoah/EchargerHelper`
- **Development Environment:** Xcode 15+, iOS 17+ target
