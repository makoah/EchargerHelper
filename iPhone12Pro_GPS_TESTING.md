- [ ] No location jumping or instability

### Test 3: Indoor vs Outdoor GPS Behavior
**Purpose**: Verify fallback mechanisms work properly

#### Outdoor Test (GPS Available)
**Location**: Open area with clear sky view
**Steps:**
1. Launch app outdoors
2. Wait for GPS lock
3. Note location accuracy
4. Verify chargers are relevant to actual location

#### Indoor Test (GPS Limited) 
**Location**: Inside building, away from windows
**Steps:**
1. Launch app indoors
2. Wait 5+ seconds for timeout
3. Verify fallback to Tarragona coordinates (41.1189, 1.2445)
4. Check that chargers shown are for Tarragona area

**Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Outdoor: Uses actual GPS coordinates
- [ ] Indoor: Falls back to Tarragona after timeout
- [ ] No crashes in either scenario
- [ ] Appropriate chargers shown for each location

### Test 4: Moving Vehicle GPS Tracking
**Purpose**: Test GPS accuracy while driving (passenger testing only)

⚠️ **SAFETY**: Only test as passenger, never while driving

**Steps:**
1. **Launch app** while stationary in vehicle
2. **Start driving** (as passenger)
3. **Monitor** location updates during movement
4. **Test** app functionality at different speeds:
   - City driving (30-50 km/h)
   - Highway driving (80-120 km/h)

**Expected Results:**
- Smooth location updates during movement
- No excessive battery drain
- App remains responsive while moving
- Location updates reflect actual position

**Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Location updates smoothly during movement
- [ ] No app crashes while vehicle moving
- [ ] Battery usage remains reasonable
- [ ] GPS accuracy maintained at highway speeds

### Test 5: Location Permission Edge Cases
**Purpose**: Test app behavior when permissions change

#### Permission Denied Test
**Steps:**
1. Install app, **deny location permission**
2. Try to use "Find Chargers"
3. Verify error handling
4. Grant permission and test again

#### Permission Revoked Test  
**Steps:**
1. Use app normally with location permission
2. **Revoke permission** in Settings
3. Return to app and test functionality
4. **Re-grant permission** and verify recovery

**Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Clear error messages when permission denied
- [ ] App doesn't crash without location access
- [ ] Graceful recovery when permission granted
- [ ] Fallback behavior works correctly

### Test 6: Battery Impact Assessment
**Purpose**: Measure GPS impact on iPhone 12 Pro battery

**Setup:**
1. **Charge iPhone 12 Pro** to 100%
2. **Note starting battery percentage**
3. **Use app** continuously for 30 minutes
4. **Check battery usage** in Settings

**Test Scenarios:**
- **Scenario A**: Stationary GPS use (30 minutes)
- **Scenario B**: Mobile GPS use (30 minutes as passenger)
- **Scenario C**: Background location tracking (if implemented)

**Expected Results:**
- Battery drain under 10% for 30 minutes of active use
- Location services not the highest battery consumer
- No excessive heating of iPhone 12 Pro

**Pass Criteria:**
- [ ] Battery drain is reasonable (under 10%/30min)
- [ ] No device overheating
- [ ] Battery usage comparable to navigation apps

## GPS Accuracy Verification Methods

### Method 1: Cross-Reference with Apple Maps
1. **Open Apple Maps** alongside ECharger Helper
2. **Compare coordinates** shown in both apps
3. **Verify** they're within 50 meters of each other

### Method 2: Known Location Testing
**Test Locations in Barcelona Area:**
- **Home Address**: Your exact address
- **Sagrada Familia**: 41.4036° N, 2.1744° E
- **Barcelona Airport**: 41.2971° N, 2.0833° E

**Verification:**
1. **Stand at known location**
2. **Launch app** and get GPS lock
3. **Verify** location is within reasonable range (100m radius)

### Method 3: GPS Coordinates Display (Debug Mode)
If needed for debugging, can temporarily add coordinate display:
```swift
// Temporary debug info in UI
Text("Lat: \(location.coordinate.latitude), Lng: \(location.coordinate.longitude)")
```
