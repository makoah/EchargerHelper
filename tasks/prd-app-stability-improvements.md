# Product Requirements Document: ECharger Helper App Stability Improvements

## Introduction/Overview

Following a comprehensive code review of the ECharger Helper iOS app, this PRD addresses critical stability issues and performance optimizations identified before device testing deployment. The goal is to resolve immediate blockers and improve app reliability with minimal disruption to existing functionality, focusing particularly on UI navigation and user flow improvements.

## Goals

1. **Eliminate Critical Blockers**: Fix issues preventing successful device testing and user access to core features
2. **Improve App Stability**: Address memory management and crash risks to ensure reliable operation
3. **Enhance Performance**: Optimize memory usage and error handling for better user experience
4. **Maintain User Flow**: Ensure users can access all implemented features through proper navigation
5. **Prepare for Production**: Secure sensitive data and implement production-ready practices

## User Stories

1. **As a Mercedes EQB driver**, I want to access app settings to manage my blacklisted chargers and view app information, so that I can customize my charging preferences.

2. **As a user**, I want the app to handle errors gracefully without crashing, so that I can continue using the app even when network or location services have issues.

3. **As a user**, I want the app to use memory efficiently during extended use, so that it doesn't slow down my phone or drain the battery unnecessarily.

4. **As a developer**, I want API keys to be securely managed, so that the app can be safely distributed without exposing sensitive credentials.

## Functional Requirements

### Critical Issues (Phase 1 - Before Device Testing)

1. **Settings Navigation Integration**
   - The main ContentView must provide access to SettingsView through a toolbar button
   - Settings screen must be presented as a modal sheet
   - Users must be able to access blacklist management, app information, and support features
   - Navigation must follow iOS design patterns with proper dismiss functionality

2. **API Key Security**
   - OpenChargeMap API key must be moved from hardcoded source to bundle configuration
   - API key must be loaded from a configuration file at runtime
   - Source code must not contain any sensitive credentials
   - Configuration approach must be simple to maintain and deploy

3. **Crash Prevention**
   - All force unwrapping operations in RealChargerService must be replaced with safe alternatives
   - Random element selection must use nil-coalescing operators with default values
   - Code must handle empty arrays and nil values gracefully

### Performance & Memory Optimizations (Phase 1)

4. **Memory Management**
   - LocationManager instances must be properly cleaned up and released
   - Service instances in views must be optimized to prevent unnecessary recreation
   - Location services must be explicitly stopped when no longer needed

5. **Error Handling Enhancement**
   - DirectionUtils functions must validate coordinate bounds before processing
   - Location permission handling must provide user-friendly guidance
   - Invalid coordinate input must be handled gracefully with appropriate fallbacks

6. **UI State Management**
   - Service instance creation in views must be optimized to prevent memory overhead
   - State management must preserve data across view lifecycles appropriately
   - UI updates must remain on main thread with proper async handling

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- Complete architectural refactoring of existing services
- Addition of new features or functionality
- Changes to the core charger finding algorithms
- UI design overhaul or visual improvements
- Integration with new external services
- Comprehensive unit test implementation (future iteration)
- App Store submission preparation beyond basic security

## Design Considerations

### UI Navigation
- Settings access via standard iOS toolbar gear icon in top-right corner
- Modal sheet presentation for settings (maintains context of main app)
- Consistent with iOS Human Interface Guidelines
- No changes to existing view layouts or styling

### Configuration Management
- Simple `.plist` or configuration file approach for API key storage
- Bundled with app for easy deployment
- Readable by standard iOS configuration loading methods
- No external dependencies or complex key management systems

## Technical Considerations

### Existing Architecture Preservation
- Maintain current MVVM pattern and service abstractions
- Preserve existing protocol-based design
- Keep current SwiftUI navigation patterns
- No changes to data models or core business logic

### iOS Compatibility
- Must work with existing iOS 18.5 target
- Compatible with iPhone 12 Pro deployment requirements
- No new framework dependencies or version requirements

### Minimal Code Changes
- Use existing patterns and conventions from codebase
- Follow established error handling approaches
- Maintain current code organization and file structure

## Success Metrics

### Pre-Testing Validation
- App builds without warnings or errors
- All critical navigation paths accessible (including settings)
- No force unwrapping crashes during basic usage testing
- API key not visible in source code review

### Device Testing Readiness
- Settings screen accessible from main interface
- App handles location permission denial gracefully
- Memory usage stable during extended use (no leaks)
- Error states display helpful user guidance

### Code Quality Improvements
- Zero force unwrapping operations in service layer
- Proper cleanup methods called in all service deinit functions
- Configuration-based API key loading implemented
- Coordinate validation added to utility functions

## Open Questions

1. **Configuration File Format**: Should API key be stored in Info.plist, separate .plist file, or JSON configuration?

2. **Error Recovery Strategy**: For location permission denials, should we provide in-app guidance or redirect to system settings?

3. **Memory Optimization Priority**: Should we optimize service instance creation immediately or wait for post-testing performance analysis?

4. **Testing Validation**: What specific user flows should be verified during the critical fixes testing phase?

## Implementation Approach

**Phase 1 (Critical - Before Device Testing):**
- Settings navigation integration
- API key security implementation  
- Crash prevention fixes

**Phase 2 (Post-Testing - Based on Results):**
- Memory management optimizations
- Enhanced error handling
- Performance monitoring integration

This phased approach ensures device testing can proceed while maintaining code stability and user experience quality.
